## Gitlab CI/CD
=====================

# Agenda:-
i.) Build basic CI/CD Pipeline           ## App Code >>> Run Test >>> Biuild Docker Image >>>  Push to Docker hub Private Registory >>> Deploy to Remore Ubuntu Server
ii.) Gitlab Architecture
iii.) Basic Concept of Gitlab CI/CD



## Gitlab :- Complete DevOps Plateform. Where you can build complete Devops workflow. Also, you don'thave to integrate with multiple external tools.
             Ex:- Plan >>> Implement >>> Test >>> Package >>> Release >>> Observe
             it's a Saas service.
         
         
# Github Instance/Serevr :- It hosts application code, execute pipelines & gitlab configuration.

# Gitlab Runner:- It is Agent which connected to Gitlab server & executes CI/CD jobs.
                  A Gitlab.com is managed Github server which manage multiple Runner. 
                  
                    
                    
  ###                     Sample Project

   ## PythonAgenda:-       Code >>> Run Test >>> Biuild Docker Image >>>  Push to Docker hub Private Registory >>> Deploy to Remore Ubuntu Server
   
   # Sample Python Code Repo:-  https://github.com/benc-uk/pthon-demoapp
   
   * git clone git@gitlsb.com:mamuchi/gitlab-cicd-crash-course.git        ## Pulling repo to local machine
   
   * cd git;ab-cicd-crash-course
   
   * cd src > app > tests > test_api.py           {##these 2 files are test files which run test case, we don;t have to worry about how it is written but execute}
                            test_views.py
                       
              
   * cd ..
   * cd ..
   * cd tests > postman.json     ##{it's a configuration file which executes test cases through test files}
